!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!
I provide the data base in SQL script in SQL-Database folder.
Connection string must be corrected in the application as well.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. The quality of the code is fairly low for my standarts, but the code works quite nicely.
2. I didn't write any Unit tests, but i hope all possible bug are handled.
3. No Try/Catch writen, coz not required by definition.
4. I would use CodeFirst approach in Entity framework, but using of SQL queries are recommended by definition.
5. I wasn't sure for the dash-board implementation, so i decide not to write it.
