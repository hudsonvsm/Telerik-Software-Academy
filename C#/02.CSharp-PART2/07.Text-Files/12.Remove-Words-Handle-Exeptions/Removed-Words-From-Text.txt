To be is to be perceived. And so to know thyself is only
possible through the eyes of the other .
The nature of our im lives is in the consequences
of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing
themselves throughout all  time.
Our lives are not our own, from womb to  tomb, we're bound to others,
 past and present. And by each crime and  every kindness, we birth our future.

I believe death is  only a door. When it closes, another opens.
If I care to imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening.
And behind it, I  would find him there. Waiting for me.
