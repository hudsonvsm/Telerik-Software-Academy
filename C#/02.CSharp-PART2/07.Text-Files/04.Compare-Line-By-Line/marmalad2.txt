To be is to be perceived. And so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other.
 The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of odur words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time.
 Our lives are not our own, from womb to tomb, we're bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.

 To be is to be perceived, and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other.
 The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time.

- Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomrsb, we are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.

- I believe death is only a door. When it closes, another opens. If I care to imagine heaven, I would imagine a door opening.
 And behind it, I would find him there. Waiting for me.
