On my PC the App works correctly start. I write a lot code for several hours.
I'm conifident i made some serious misteke. Proububly several.
I did what i can. The Console app works in local server, but when i try to send to 
MongoDB it throws an authentication exeption. I don't know what i did wrong.
The connection string looks correct, but... :(
